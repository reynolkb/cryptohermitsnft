				We are a married couple whose aim is to stay anonymous. Thus proving who we are in terms of controversial societal categories like gender, race, and political affiliations do not
				matter. Our beliefs and character define us. The elites do not get to divide us unless we consent to prioritizing our differences compared to our similarities. We are all together on
				this beautiful planet; join the rebellion of hermits. This is the way.
