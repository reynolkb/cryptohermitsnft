					Due to the social climate we have decided to stay anonymous. This reaffirms something we strongly believe in. Who we are in the terms of controversial categories like gender, race,
					and political affiliations do not matter. Our beliefs and character define us. The elites do not get to divide us unless we consent to prioritizing our differences compared to our
					similarities. We are all together on this beautiful planet; join the rebellion of hermits. This is the way.
